Q. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’
A. Null refers to an intentional absence of value. In JavaScript, null can be assigned to a variable to represent 'no-value'. The data type null is an object.

On the other hand, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. Undefined is a type by itself (undefined). Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.

When used in arithmetic operations, undefined will result in NaN (not a number), whereas null will be converted to 0 behind the screens.
